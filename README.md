## Overview

The Polymarket Copy Trading Bot automatically replicates trades from successful Polymarket traders to your wallet. Instead of manually tracking top performers, the bot monitors their activity 24/7 and executes proportionally sized trades on your behalf.

### How It Works

1. **Select Traders** - Choose top performers from [Polymarket leaderboard](https://polymarket.com/leaderboard) or [Predictfolio](https://predictfolio.com)
2. **Monitor Trades** - Bot continuously watches for new positions opened by your selected traders
3. **Calculate Position Size** - Automatically scales trades based on your balance vs. trader's balance
4. **Execute Orders** - Places matching orders on Polymarket using your wallet
5. **Track Performance** - Logs all activity and maintains trade history in MongoDB

### Position Sizing Example

If you're tracking a trader with $10,000 and they buy $500 worth of shares:

- Your balance: $1,000
- Position ratio: `$1,000 / ($10,000 + $500) = 9.5%`
- Base trade size: `$500 √ó 9.5% = $47.50`
- With 2x multiplier: `$47.50 √ó 2 = $95.00`

The bot ensures you maintain proportional exposure relative to the traders you follow, and you can amplify positions using the multiplier.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher

2. Look for traders with:

    - Positive P&L (green)
    - Win rate above 55%
    - Active trading history
    - Position sizes you can afford to copy proportionally

3. Check their detailed stats on [Predictfolio](https://predictfolio.com)

### Trading Logic

**Buy Strategy:**

- Calculates position ratio: `your_balance / (trader_balance + trade_size)`
- Scales trade size proportionally to your capital
- Applies multiplier to final trade size
- Checks minimum order size ($1 minimum required by Polymarket)
- Checks price slippage (max $0.05 difference)
- Executes market order at best available price

**Sell Strategy:**

- Mirrors trader's sell percentage
- Applies multiplier to position sizing
- If trader sells 20% of position, bot sells 20% of yours (√ó multiplier)
- If trader closes entire position, bot closes yours completely

**Trade Multiplier:**

The `TRADE_MULTIPLIER` allows you to amplify or reduce your position sizes relative to the calculated ratio:

- `1.0` (default) - Exact proportional copying
- `2.0` - Double the position size (more aggressive)
- `0.5` - Half the position size (more conservative)

**Example:**

```
Trader (Balance: $50,000) buys $5,000 (10% of capital)
You (Balance: $1,000, Multiplier: 2.0)

Position ratio: 1,000 / 55,000 = 0.0182 (1.82%)
Base trade: $5,000 √ó 0.0182 = $91
With 2x multiplier: $91 √ó 2.0 = $182 (actual trade size)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Higher multipliers increase both potential gains and losses. Use with caution!

**Trade Aggregation (NEW!):**

Trade aggregation solves a common problem: traders often make multiple small trades that individually fall below Polymarket's $1 minimum, but together represent a meaningful position worth copying.

How it works:

- When enabled, the bot collects small BUY trades (below $1) in a buffer
- Trades are grouped by trader, market, and side (BUY/YES or BUY/NO)
- After the time window expires (default: 300 seconds / 5 minutes), aggregated trades are executed as one order
- The bot calculates a weighted average price based on all individual trades
- If the combined total is still below $1, the trades are skipped and logged

**Configuration:**

```bash
TRADE_AGGREGATION_ENABLED = true              # Enable the feature
TRADE_AGGREGATION_WINDOW_SECONDS = 300        # Wait 5 minutes (default)
```

**Example scenario:**

```
Trader makes 3 small BUY trades on "Will Trump meet with Putin?":
  Trade 1: $0.35 @ 52¬¢  (1:00 PM)
  Trade 2: $0.25 @ 51¬¢  (1:02 PM)
  Trade 3: $0.50 @ 53¬¢  (1:04 PM)

Without aggregation: All 3 trades skipped (below $1 minimum)

With aggregation enabled:
  - Trades collected in buffer for 5 minutes
  - At 1:05 PM window expires
  - Total: $1.10
  - Weighted average price: $52.27¬¢
  - ‚úì Executed as single $1.10 order
```

This feature is especially useful when copying traders who:

- "Scale into" positions with multiple small entries
- Test markets with small trades before committing larger capital
- Trade across many markets with small position sizes

## Safety and Risk Management

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimers:**

- **Use at your own risk** - This bot executes real trades with real money
- **Start small** - Test with minimal funds before scaling up
- **Diversify** - Don't copy just one trader; track 3-5 different strategies
- **Monitor regularly** - Check bot logs daily to ensure proper execution
- **Set limits** - The current version has no built-in stop-loss or position limits
- **No guarantees** - Past performance of copied traders doesn't guarantee future results

### Best Practices

1. **Dedicated Wallet** - Use a separate wallet just for the bot, not your main funds
2. **Limited Capital** - Only allocate what you can afford to lose
3. **Research Traders** - Verify trader history and strategy before copying
4. **Active Monitoring** - Set up alerts and check the bot at least once daily
5. **Emergency Stop** - Know how to stop the bot quickly (Ctrl+C)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not detecting trades:**

- Verify trader addresses are correct
- Check that traders are actively trading
- Ensure MongoDB connection is stable

**Trades failing to execute:**

- Confirm USDC balance in `PROXY_WALLET`
- Verify you have MATIC for gas fees
- Check `RPC_URL` is responding (try pinging endpoint)

**Price slippage errors:**

- Current slippage tolerance is $0.05
- Markets may be moving too fast
- Consider increasing `FETCH_INTERVAL` to reduce race conditions
